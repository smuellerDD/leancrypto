/** @defgroup X509Gen X.509 Certificate Generate Handling
 *
 * Concept of X.509 certificate generate handling in leancrypto
 *
 * The leancrypto library provides an X.509 generator which can create
 * X.509 certificates. The generator does not enforce any X.509 limitations and
 * thus allows the caller to generate any combination of field offered by the
 * X.509 specification. To appropriately use the X.509 parser, please consider
 * the following rules:
 *
 * 1. The generated X.509 data blob is independent of the original X.509
 *    certificate data structure.
 *
 * 2. The generator does not allocate any memory. All memory MUST be provided
 *    by the caller. Thus, if the caller provides insufficient memory, the
 *    generator will return -EOVERFLOW.
 *
 * 3. Before invoking the X.509 generator, the caller must allocate an
 *    \p lc_x509_certificate data structure (e.g. on stack) and fill it with the
 *    numerous setter functions to add data.
