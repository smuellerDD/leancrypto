Changes 1.4.0
* ML-DSA: add signature generation rejection test cases and enable them during self tests

* add HQC following reference implementation (https://pqc-hqc.org/implementation.html (versions from 2025-02-19)) but derived from PQClean implementation. NOTE: HQC is not yet considered stable as the implementation currently does not exhibit the IND-CCA2 property. Moreover, the FIPS standardization of HQC is pending. Changes to the HQC algorithm until standardization will need to be expected. I.e. the versioning rules of the library do not apply to the HQC algorithm until being announced in the CHANGES.md file.

* ARMv8: properly save/restore SIMD registers v8 through v15 for ML-DSA/ML-KEM, X25519 and SHA3-CE (reported by Alexander Sosedkin)

* Rust: add wrapper allowing a native interaction with the leancrypto library - the API offered by the Rust wrappers is not yet defined to be stable and may change to the next version - i.e. the versioning rules of the library do not apply to the Rust API until being announced in the CHANGES.md file.

* ML-KEM: add key pair PCT API - leancrypto cannot invoke it itself as it does not know when both keys are provided from outside

* ML-DSA, ML-KEM, SLH-DSA, BIKE, Hash, AEAD, RNG, HMAC, HKDF, symmetric: move API implementation from H to C file - this implies that no RUST wrappers are needed

Changes 1.0.1

* fix: Kyber keygen - add LC_KYBER_K to initial hash (change is only relevant when storing keys as seed and for interoperability)

* due to the Dilithium-ED25519 stream mode support, the Dilithium-ED25519 now used ED25519ph signature algorithm mode

* Dilithium API change: the stream mode uses struct lc_dilithium_ctx instead of lc_hash_ctx to reflect the newly added Dilithium-ED25519 API - the lc_dilithium_ctx can be allocated on the stack or heap using LC_DILITHIUM_CTX_ON_STACK or lc_dilithium_ctx_alloc

* Dilithium: add edge case tests as referenced by https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP/pull/1525.patch and https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/G8Zf0hC-uu0/m/Kb3qNJb0AwAJ
