- linker version script - how do I do that with meson?

- Linux kernel Makefile: make clean does not prune files generated by sources
  wrapped in ifdefs in Makefile

- how to detect ARMv6 (in contrast to ARMv7) such that ARMv7 Neon code is only
  compiled for target host ARMv7 - at the moment compiling on ARMv6 fails
  because the Neon code is compiled (which should not be compiled)

- provide version numbers in one place (currently found in meson.build, leancrypto.spec and Kbuild.version)

- BIKE: add self tests

- BIKE: add timecop

- ARMv8: enable ARMv8 intrinsics in the kernel (SHAKE2x and by extension SLH-DSA)

- RISCV64: update internal/src/cpufeatures_riscv_auxv.c once kernels report ZBB correctly

- SHA2 Neon: check whether it works on ARMv7

- RISCV asm: check whether it works for RISCV32

- Add SLH-DSA-Ascon to Linux kernel

- Linux kernel: enable ASN.1 on 32 bit systems (due to gmtime.c divisions, __divdi3 (i586) and __aeabi_divmod (armv7) are included by compiler)

- Linux kernel: add support for streaming XTS mode (is this really needed?)
