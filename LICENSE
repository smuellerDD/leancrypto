The Keccak assembler implementation in hash/src/asm/riscv is derived in parts

This code is MIT licensed.

================================================================================

The x86intrin code in internal/api/ext_x86_*.h are derived from GCC and Clang.
The only reason why this code is duplicated is the fact that the compiler code
cannot be included into kernel code code as is. Thus, the functions used by
leancrypto are extracted - I wished this would not have been necessary.

In addition, the functions found in bike/src/compiler_support.c are derived
from the LLVM project as well.

Anyhow, the GCC code is: GPL 3. The LLVM code is: Apache License v2.0.
